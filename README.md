### Documentation for the "Business Card Creator" App

The "Business Card Creator" app is developed for Android, utilizing modern libraries and tools. The minimum allowed Android version for the app is SDK 24, corresponding to Android 7.0, while the target is SDK 34 (Android 14). The use of Data and View Binding simplifies working with interface elements and data. The use of Navigation Components allows for efficient navigation management between the app's screens. Koin is used for dependency injection, providing more flexibility and testability of the code. Kotlin and AndroidX plugins offer additional capabilities and optimizations for working with Kotlin and Android Jetpack.

#### Security and File Handling
The app has permissions to work with external storage. Using `FileProvider` ensures safety when working with files, limiting access to the app's files for other apps.

### Detailed Overview of Technologies in the "Business Card Creator" App
1. **Koin**
   - What it is: Koin is a lightweight library for dependency injection in Android. Imagine your app as a large constructor, where each part (component) needs other parts to function. Koin helps connect these parts together, simplifying code organization and management.
   - Benefits: It ensures code cleanliness, making your app's components easier to test and modify. Koin also simplifies dependency management without complicating the code.

2. **R8**
   - What it is: R8 is a code optimization tool that minimizes and obfuscates your app's code. It removes unused code (so-called "code pruning") and makes the code harder to read if someone tries to decompile your app.
   - Benefits: It reduces the app's size and improves its performance. It also helps protect your code from unauthorized use.

3. **Navigation Component**
   - What it is: Navigation Component is a set of tools from Android that helps manage navigation between different screens (fragments) in an app.
   - Benefits: It simplifies the navigation process, helps manage transitions between screens, data transfer, and interaction with the menu. It also makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.

4. **Data Binding**
   - What it is: Data Binding is a process that allows you to directly link UI components in your layouts with data (e.g., variables in the code).
   - Benefits: It reduces the amount of code needed to interact with interface elements and helps prevent errors related to updating the user interface.

5. **View Binding**
   - What it is: View Binding is a technology that allows easy interaction with visual components of your interface.
   - Benefits: It lets you easily find and use UI elements in the code, reducing the risk of errors and simplifying interface work.

6. **Clean Architecture**
   - What it is: Clean Architecture is a conceptual approach to structuring code that helps separate different aspects of the program into individual layers (e.g., user logic, data access).
   - Benefits: It aims to create a structure of the application where changes in one part minimally affect others. This eases testing, maintenance, and future expansion of the app.

Each of these technologies contributes to the efficiency, security, and ease of code management in the "Business Card Creator" app, making it more reliable, productive, and easier to develop.
